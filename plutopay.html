                    <h2>Context for the Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        Economic inequality is rampant in the U.S. today and can easily be seen by the everwidening
                        wealth gap. The bottom 90% of Americans only own 32% of U.S. wealth,
                        according to the
                        <a
                            href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#range:2006.4,2021.4;quarter:129;series:Net%20worth;demographic:networth;population:1,3,5,7,9;units:levels">
                            Federal Reserve.</a>
                        These numbers were exacerbated by the 2020
                        pandemic and the numerous financial hardships that still face Americans in the
                        years that have since followed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lots of working-class Americans simply want to achieve financial stability and the freedom that
                        comes with it. But…
                    </p>
                    <h3>"Money is complicated."</h3>
                    <p>
                        Well, I don't think it has to be. I believe that better finance solutions can help
                        alleviate some of the undue complications that everyday Americans face while
                        navigating their finances. Pluto Pay is my design solution to this problem.

                        I conducted remote user interviews with 23-35yr old working adults with a high debt-to-income

                            All interviewees had a fairly good idea of what they should be doing in order to reach
                            financial stability, but income and time seemed to be the biggest factors in why they
                            hadn't reached their financial goals yet. Although most interviewees knew generally what
                            they should be doing, there was still a belief that money is too complicated. Some
                            participants even bought books and listened to money podcasts, but their interest waned
                            dramatically since there was "so much to know."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The interviews were helpful for me to understand that "more money" isn't necessarily the
                            goal for people, but a life of security, safety, and independence was far more
                            important than just being able to buy things. The interviews also helped me to know what
                            features people prefer to use when managing their money and the importance people place on
                            simplicity.

                            Once I understood the behaviors, pain points, and goals of real people, I began to see three
                            distinct target users take shape. I created design personas to better understand what each
                            user found most important as well as a way to empathize with my potential users throughout
                            the entire design process.

                            Caring Carla is the main financial planner for her family but has trouble managing
                            multiple accounts, bills, and goals. She wants to spend more time with her family, and less
                            time worrying about balancing the budget with enough surplus to reach her family goals.

                    <p>
                        Next, I put myself in their shoes and created journey maps for each persona. This helped me to
                        understand how they might feel while trying to complete some of their goals within our app. This
                        allowed me to find potential issues before they become a pain point for real users as well as
                        begin thinking about the feature opportunities for PlutoPay.

                            flows to help me visualize the logical paths that best accommodate my users while also
                            revealing essential pages, features, and functions needed in order to complete the tasks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then built a preliminary sitemap and organized the pages/screens by using a hybrid of flat
                            and hierarchical structures in order to preserve simplicity within the app's navigation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I refined the sitemap by analyzing data from an open card sorting exercise where
                            participants organized 30 features/tasks into groups and labeled their groups. I wanted
                            PlutoPay to closely follow existing mental models for basic finance management and this
                            exercise helped me to understand what features users often grouped together and how they
                            might refer to them.

                        <h3>Foundational Pages/Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Home - dashboard with most common budgeting, accounting, and payment tools.</li>
                            <li>Grow* - automation and tracking of goals and investments.</li>
                            <li>Learn - educational content to assess and build financial well-being and literacy.</li>
                            <li>Rewards* - robust incentive system that rewards healthy financial habits.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "Rewards" was initially labeled "achievements" and nested under the profile tab as a way to
                            access all deals and rewards unlocked or achieved by the user through app usage and
                            learning. However further research showed that Profile tabs are usually separate from the
                            navigation bar pages. In most of the competitor apps, both Profile and Notifications were
                            often found in the upper right corner, set apart from the main navigation menu. I decided to
                            follow this convention so that PlutoPay would be easy to navigate for new users. Since
                            "Rewards" is a major feature, however, I removed it from being nested under the profile
                            section and gave it its own main page on the navigation bar as a foundational page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also renamed "Goals" to "Grow" because it encompasses multiple ways to grow wealth,
                            including investments, not just contributions to goals. Grow also connotes a healthy and
                            steady increase and matches the leaf logo of PlutoPay.

                        During the prototype phase, I made an interactive mid-fidelity prototype of the foundational
                        pages and most common management tools. Major decisions from this process are as follows:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Bottom navigation showcasing 4 high-level sections of the app to highlight each

                        <li>Primary pages include overview cards that open up to secondary pages housing
                            section-specific information and details. Important summary information can be found on the
                            card itself, for easy at-a-glace digestion of key financial information.</li>
                        <li>Profile & Notifications separate from main navigation menu.</li>

                        PlutoPay's prototype offers financial tools that help users increase financial literacy by
                        helping to track their spending and encourage regular saving. With this prototype, I wanted to
                        validate PlutoPay's usability and usefulness. I conducted in-person moderated user testing to
                        answer the following:
                    </p>
                    <div>

                            <li>Where are there still points of friction within each task?</li>
                            <li>What is essential to the app that has yet to be incorporated?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Methodology:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Six adult participants, 23-35 years old.</li>
                            <li>Moderated, In-Person.</li>
                            <li>Three scenarios with relevant tasks to complete.</li>
                            <li>Debrief and survey following task completion.</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        After testing concluded, I reviewed notes and recordings of each session and separated notes
                        into observations of how users think, what they feel, and how they interact with the prototype.
                        I also noted specific errors users made and rated them based on the Jakob Nielson scale and
                        color-coded based on participant.

                        After testing PlutoPay's usability through a mid-fidelity prototype, I updated the app to better
                        reflect user mental models and provide additional clarity for more unfamiliar features.

                        Afterward, I explored emotional design strategies and solutions using UI fundamentals to build a
                        cohesive experience across the updated prototype. I used Gestalt principles of design, Google's
                        Material Design 3 framework conventions, and peer feedback to refine PlutoPay's design into a
                        unified visual language, ready for developer handoff.

                        I focused on the effect of color palettes, typography, and graphic elements on the user
                        experience. As well as standardization of elements in order to facilitate a smooth hand-off to
                        the development team. Consistency and a well-branded design will help gain the trust of our
                        target users who will need to share lots of sensitive financial data with the app.

                    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prototype and test additional features.</li>
                        <li>Expand style guide and pattern library.</li>
                        <li>Explore design patterns for iOS.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Now that the first iteration of a design language and high-fidelity prototypes are set, I would
                        like to add additional features and test their usability with users. Most of the flows in the
                        current prototype address features that are necessary simply to compete with other finance
                        management apps. But I'd like to test some of the features that I believe will set PlutoPay
                        apart from the competition, such as Round-ups, Financial health assessment, and Reward
                        incentives. In addition to designing and testing these features, It is also important to start
                        designing the visual language of PlutoPay for iOS users, since the Android conventions will
                        likely not translate well.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many Americans want to reach financial stability and the freedom that comes with it but
                        struggling adults are often discouraged by their slow progress and lack of financial literacy.
                        Managing their finances can seem overwhelming and complicated. In order to alleviate this issue,
                        I spent time researching, designing, and testing a financial management app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My app, PlutoPay, speeds up savings through automation, education, and smart management tools
                        that help users build long-term financial health and reach financial freedom faster.
