                        <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>
                            In my 5 years as a working professional, I've had the chance to tell compelling stories, design graphics, lead workshops, streamline efficient systems and workflows, optimize infrastructure, conceptualize complex applications, collaborate with peers, and build functional prototypes. But my favorite thing to do, by far, is tackling my favorite questions, “Why?” and “How?” I’m interested in why things work the way they do, why people act the way they do, and how to inspire emotion and action from this expertise. I’m in love with envisioning the big picture and strategy to solve real problems, and I excel at considering the minute details along the way.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Introduction to UX</h3>
                        <p>
                            My transition into UX was a slow one. For my first job, I was part of a church's small media team as the only video producer and editor. I spent most of my time planning, filming, and editing video content. However, I also had the unique opportunity to work closely with the resident graphic designer/webmaster and had the privilege to participate in strategic meetings for the church. “Why not do things differently?” and “How might we…?” discussions constantly filled our office and created a buzz inside of me I didn’t quite know what to call.
                            <br>
                            When the pandemic hit in 2020, and the need for filmmaking in my position waned, I finally got my chance to focus on digital design projects and user-centered problem-solving. I redesigned parts of our website to help parishioners find answers to their most common sacrament questions faster and without needing to visit the office. I also designed an online registration process for religious education classes since the pandemic restrictions limited in-person registration.
                            <br>
                            Of course, at this point, I had no idea about the formal terms for design-thinking and user experience design. I just knew that I loved it and I wanted more.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Plans for Continued Growth</h3>
                        <p>
                            A cross-country move from Austin to San Francisco, a full-time job in a tech startup, and part-time enrollment in an online UX design program set me on the path that I am now.
                            <br>
                            In my design program at CareerFoundry, I had the chance to conceptualize and design a finance management app, honing my skills in qualitative research, wireframing, prototype testing, and responsive web design.
                            <br>
                            At the same time, in my role as a Production Technician at Tempo Interactive, Inc. I not only contributed to a high-quality library of fitness content but also led critical redesign initiatives for our studio infrastructure and editing workflows.
                            <br>
                            I really do love the design process and the ability to create efficient, useful, and delightful experiences and I look forward to growing my design career in a company and team that values asking hard questions, continuously pushes for innovation, and sees setbacks as opportunities for growth.
